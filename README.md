## Brief Description

Design and implement a system that is capable to handle a portion of required exams and actions to make a functional ICU Hospital on call.

This includes the:

- creation of the patients, nurses, doctors
- creation of the night shifts and the patient visits,
- the symptoms the patient is having,
- the doctor assignment based on the symptoms,
- the exams the patient has to undergo,
- the diagnosis and
- the treatment he should receive.

The implementation of the system should also provide the user interface to support all these actions.

## Files and Folders

- cs360.sql is the initialization of the database for testing
- Within the `/Project` folder:
  - There is the main code under the `../java` folder to handle the communication between the interface and the database along with all the required functionalities
  - There is the `../webapp` folder that contains all the files required to have a functional user interface
